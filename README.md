# playing-with-rpi
THis is my notes from playing with RaspberryPi and TurnKey Linux

Currently this whole repo is a mess and is essentially brain
dumps/reminders/useful code snippets and dead ends...

It it's current condition it is not intended for public consumption...

But if you find someting useful; awesome! :)

FWIW these files are potentially useful (and have been tidied):

#raspbian-ua-netinst-qemu-prep.sh 
&#35; a copy of a script by https://github.com/dhanar10

#QEMU-setup
&#35; instructions on setting up QEMU on TKL Core host 
and creating a basic RPi VM running a # minimalist 
Raspbian; inc workaround for limited RAM and poor RAM
managment (I initially had issues running out of /tmp)

#daemonise-qemu
&#35; command for launching QEMU as a headless daemon
